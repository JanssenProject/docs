## Overview

[FIDO 2.0 (FIDO2)](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) is an open authentication standard that enables people to leverage common devices to authenticate to online services in both mobile and desktop environments.

FIDO2 is comprised of the [W3C’s Web Authentication specification (WebAuthn)](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) and FIDO’s corresponding [Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20170927/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20170927.html). WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be built into browsers and related web platform infrastructure to enable online services to use FIDO Authentication. CTAP enables external devices such as mobile handsets or FIDO Security Keys to work with WebAuthn and serve as authenticators to desktop applications and web services.

Janssen includes a FIDO2 service to implement a two-step, two-factor authentication (2FA) with username / password as the first step, and any FIDO2 device as the second step. 

## API Reference

The API reference for the Janssen FIDO2 service is included in the Janssen Swagger documentation <link>. 

## Code Reference

A discovery document for FIDO2 is published by the Gluu Server at: `https://<hostname>/.well-known/fido2-configuration` This document specifies the URL of the registration and authentication endpoints.

## Deployment

During Janssen installation, the administrator will have the option to also install the FIDO2 service. 

## Data

The FIDO2 service stores device credentials in the same persistence mechanism used by the Janssen deployment.

## Testing

## User Guide

### Credential enrollment
FIDO2 device enrollment happens automatically during the first authentication attempt. 

### Subsequent authentications
All subsequent FIDO2 authentications for that user account will require the enrolled FIDO2 key. 

### FIDO2 credential management
A user's FIDO2 devices can be removed by a Gluu administrator in LDAP under the user entry as shown in the below screenshot. <image>
