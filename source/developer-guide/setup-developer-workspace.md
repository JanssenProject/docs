# Setup Developer Workspace for Janssen

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Get Code and Build](#get-code-and-build)
- [Configure Jetty](#configure-jetty)
- [Setup JSON Web Keys](#setup-JSON-web-keys)
- [Setup data store](#setup-data-store)
- [Configure workspace](#configure-workspace)
- [Start Janssen Auth Server](#start-janssen-auth-server)

## Prerequisites

#### IDE

This guide uses IntellijIdea Java IDE to setup workspace. Any other IDE can be used to perform steps mentioned in this guide. IDE should support JDK version 11 or later in order to support Janssen development. Refer to Janssen documentation to find out current JDK version required by Janssen.

#### MySQL

Janssen needs persistance storage to store configuration and transactional data.
Janssen supports variety of persistance technologies including LDAP, RDBMS and cloud storage.
For this guide, we are going to use MySQL relational database as our persistance store. On a Ubuntu system, you can install MySql using command below:

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

## Get Code and Build

- open intellij and create a `new project from version control` using [Github repo](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-auth-server) for `jans-auth-server`
- Now we can build the project using Idea's `run/debug configurations`. 
  - Create a new `maven` configuration named `jans-auth-server-parent` and give command line as `clean install` and under `Java options` make sure that JDK-11 (any distribution) is selected. If not the you may have to install and configure JDK-11 here. Jans prefers Amazon Corretto distribution. Also, add `skip tests` option by clicking `modify` on `java options`.

- Assign host name to your local IP address by adding below entry in `/etc/hosts` file

	```
	127.0.0.1       test.local.jans.io
	```
Here, `test.local.jans.io` can be any name of your choice. We will refer to `test.local.jans.io` as our host name for rest of this guide.

## Configure Jetty

Janssen uses Jetty to run application service. For the purpose of development Janssen uses Jetty Maven plug-in for quick deployments and testing. This plug-in is already a part of project dependencies, so developers do not need to add separately. Following steps will configure Jetty Maven plug-in to deploy Janssen.

### Download Jetty configuration xml files 

Download files listed below. Files will be required by Jetty to enable ssl and other configuration:
- [jetty.xml](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/jetty.xml)
- [jetty-http.xml](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/jetty-http.xml)
- [jetty-ssl.xml](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/jetty-ssl.xml)
- [jetty-ssl-context.xml](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/jetty-ssl-context.xml)
- [jetty-https.xml](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/jetty-https.xml)

(or you can get same files from a downloaded Jetty distribution from `<jetty-home>/etc`)

and put these files under

```
jans-auth-server/server/src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF
```

### Configure Jetty for HTTPS

To configure Jetty to work with HTTPS, we have to setup certificate. We will use Java keytool to generate key pair as given below.
    
```
keytool -genkeypair -alias jetty -keyalg EC -groupname secp256r1 -keypass secret -validity 3700 -storetype JKS -keystore keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks -storepass <password-of-choice>
```

Above command will create a `.jks` file in the same directory from where you have executed the command. Copy this keystore file to  
```
jans-auth-server/server/src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF
```

- update `jans-auth-server/server/pom.xml` with `<jettyXml>` and `contextPath` elements under `jetty-mave-plugin` as shown in section below:

  ```
  			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
				<artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>9.4.31.v20200723</version>
				<configuration>
					<jettyXml>src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty.xml,src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty-http.xml,src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty-ssl.xml,src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty-ssl-context.xml,src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty-https.xml</jettyXml>
					<webAppConfig>
						<descriptor>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}/WEB-INF/web.xml</descriptor>
						<contextPath>/jans-auth</contextPath>
					</webAppConfig>
					<webAppSourceDirectory>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}</webAppSourceDirectory>
					<scanIntervalSeconds>3</scanIntervalSeconds>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
  ```

- update `jans-auth-server/server/src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/jetty-ssl-context.xml`
- update following properties as mentioned below:
  ```
  <Set name="KeyStorePath">src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks</Set>
  <Set name="KeyStorePassword">{replace with your keystore password}</Set>
  <Set name="KeyManagerPassword">{replace with your keystore password}</Set>
  <Set name="TrustStorePath">src/main/webapp-jetty/WEB-INF/keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks</Set>
  <Set name="TrustStorePassword">{replace with your keystore password}</Set>
  ```


## Setup JSON Web Keys

- Janssen source comes with keys that are required for running tests. Add these keys to keystore.

   ```
   keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <auth-server-code-dir>/server/profiles/default/client_keystore.jks -destkeystore keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks
   ```

- Generate JWT

   - To generate JWT, we will use a utility Jar file. Download this file from [here](https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-auth-client/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/)
   - now run command as given below. This command adds additional keys in `keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks` and creates a JSON file with web keys. We will use web keys files later to update in our persistence store.
     ```
	   java -Dlog4j.defaultInitOverride=true -cp /tmp/jans-auth-client-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.jans.as.client.util.KeyGenerator -keystore './keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks' -keypasswd secret -sig_keys RS256 RS384 RS512 ES256 ES384 ES512 -enc_keys RS256 RS384 RS512 ES256 ES384 ES512 -dnname 'CN=Jans Auth CA Certificates' -expiration 365 > /tmp/keys/keys_client_keystore.json
     ```
- Move `keystore.test.local.jans.io.jks` file created above to `/etc/certs` and rename it to `jans-auth-keys.jks`. At a later stage, we will point Janssen to look for certificates under `/etc/certs`.

## Setup Persistance Store

Janssen uses persistance storage to hold configuration and transactional data. 
Janssen supports variety of persistance mechanisms including LDAP, RDBMS and cloud storage.
For this guide, we are going to use MySQL relational database as a persistance store. 

As a first step, let's create a schema and a user.

- Log into MySQL

  ```
  sudo mysql
  ```
  
- Create new database(schema) for Janssen

  ```
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE jansdb;
  ```
  
- Create new db user 
  ```
  CREATE USER 'jans'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PassOfYourChoice';
  ```
- Grant privileges to new user on `jansdb` schema 
  ```
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jansdb.* TO 'jans'@'localhost';
  ```
- Exit MySQL login 

### Load Initial Data Set

Next, we will load basic configuration and test data into MySQL. Janssen modules require configuration data
 at the time of start up and test data is needed to run integration tests. 

```
TODO:
Add link to script below. This script is essentially export of entire Janssen schema including test data. Generation of this script needs to be automated. Plan is to have Jenkins build create this data dump script after every successful installtion on integration servers. Similar mechanism has be to established for other persistence types like LDAP, Spanner etc. Once this script is generated, it has to be made available via a link (hosted servers or stored in GH repo)
```

[Download](TODO add link here) data import script. This script is a generic script and we have to edit certain values as per our local setup as described in steps below.

#### Update hostname
we need to replace generic host name in the script with the one that we have set for our local environment. Which is `test.local.jans.io`. 
To do this, open script in a text editor and perform following replacements.
        
  -   replace string `https://testmysql.dd.jans.io` with `https://test.local.jans.io:8443` 
  
  -   replace string `testmysql.dd.jans.io` with `test.local.jans.io`

```
TODO:
Replace 'testmysql.dd.jans.io' above with actual host name from final script
```

#### Update keystore secret in database config

- Search for string `keyStoreSecret` in the script and replace corresponding value with secret you used while creating keystore in [configuration](#configure-jetty-for-https) step.

- Import data load script into your local MySQL

  ```
  sudo mysql -u root -p jansdb < jansdb_dump.sql;
  ```

#### Update JSON Web keys in database config

Now we need to update JSON web keys in DB with what we have generated during [Setup JSON Web Keys](#setup-json-web-keys).

- login to mysql with user `jans`

  ```
  sudo mysql -u jans -p jansdb
  ```
  
- Run the update query as below after replacing `JWKs content` with multiline content from `/tmp/keys/keys_client_keystore.json`:

  ```
  UPDATE jansdb.jansAppConf SET jansConfWebKeys = 'JWKs content' where doc_id = "jans-auth";
  ```

At this point, database is ready to support Janssen server.

## Configure Properties

Now that we have configured Jetty plug-in and persistent store, we need to update properties files in our code base so that server can connect to persistent store.

Under `jans-auth-server/server/conf`, we have two property files:
  - `jans.properties`: Properties like type of persistance to use, localtion of certificates etc.
  - `jans-sql.properties`: Properties for SQL persistence store
    
- Update `jans.properties`
  -   edit `persistence.type` to `persistence.type= sql` since we are using MySQL as our backend
  -   edit `certsDir` to `certsDir=/etc/certs`
  -   edit value of `jansAuth_ConfigurationEntryDN` to `jansAuth_ConfigurationEntryDN=ou=jans-auth,ou=configuration,o=jans` 

- Update `jans-sql.properties`
  - Set `db.schema.name` to `jansdb` as our MySql schema
  - Set `connection.uri` to `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jansdb`
  - Set `connection.driver-property.serverTimezone` to `UTC`
  - Set `auth.userName` to `jans` as database user
  - Set `auth.userPassword` to passwod for `jans` db user
  - Set `password.encryption.method` to method you have selected to encrypt the password for `userPassword` property. For developer setup, since we are using plain text password, comment out this property.
    
  Other properties from `jans-sql.properies` file can be set to standard values as given below.

  ```
  # Connection pool size
  connection.pool.max-total=40
  connection.pool.max-idle=15
  connection.pool.min-idle=5

  # Max time needed to create connection pool in milliseconds
  connection.pool.create-max-wait-time-millis=20000

  # Max wait 20 seconds
  connection.pool.max-wait-time-millis=20000

  # Allow to evict connection in pool after 30 minutes
  connection.pool.min-evictable-idle-time-millis=180000
  ```

## Start Janssen Auth Server

Now we are ready to run Janssen server. You can run this via maven command or by creating run configuration in IntellijIdea.

### Using Maven

Run below maven command from root of `server` module

```
mvn -DskipTests -Djans.base=./target -Dlog.base=/home/dhaval/temp/logs/jans-logs jetty:run-war
```

### Using Idea run configuration

- Open IntellijIdea's `run/debug configurations` dialogue and create a copy of previously created run configuration `jans-auth-server-parent`. And update following: 
  - change working directory to `jans-auth-server` by selecting `jans-auth-server/server`
  - change the `command line` arguments to `jetty:run-war`
  - Add following `VM arguments` to `java options`
   ```
   -Djans.base=./target -Dlog.base=<dir-for-logs>
   ```

You can varify if the server is up by accessing: 
```
https://test.local.jans.io:8443/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
```
