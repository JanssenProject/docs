# Janssen client-api Documentation

!!! Attention
    Questions and feedback on Janssen client-api can be directed to [Gluu support](https://support.gluu.org).  


## Introduction
Janssen client-api exposes simple, static APIs web application developers can use to implement user authentication and authorization against an external OAuth 2.0 authorization server like [Janssen](https://jans.io/docs/). The Janssen client-api Linux package includes the Janssen client-api server which is a simple REST application. The server is designed to work over the web (via https), making it possible for many apps across many servers to leverage a central service for OAuth 2.0 security.

## Architecture 
Janssen client-api saves data in its own persistence (`RDMBS`, `redis`, etc.) and acts as RP for OP. It is possible that the admin goes to OP directly and change client data there. In that case, oxd will not know about it and can act on outdated data. To prevent this confusion user can configure client during registration so that oxd can automatically synchronize with the client data from OP whenever required. Check [Register site](./api/index.md#register-site) for more details.

## Get Started

To get started:

1. [Install](https://jans.io/docs/ce/installation-guide) Janssen CE and ensure to hit Y when `Install client-api?` is prompted while running [setup scripts](https://jans.io/docs/ce/5.0/installation-guide/setup_py/#setup-prompt).

1. [Configure](./configuration/client-api-configuration/index.md) the `client-api-server`           

1. Restart Janssen client-api server using below command.

    **Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial)**

    |Operation | Command|
    |------ |------ |
    |Restart jans-client-api server | `/etc/init.d/jans-client-api-server restart` |

    **Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic)/Debian 9 (stretch)/CentOS 7/RHEL 7**

    |Operation | Command|
    |------ |------ |
    |Restart jans-client-api server | `systemctl restart jans-client-api-server` |

1. After Janssen Server Community Edition (CE) installation is completed wait for about 10 minutes in total for the server to restart and finalize its configuration. After that period, to access Janssen server CE, sign in via a web browser to `hostname` provided during installation. For quick check whether client-api-server is alive use oxd `Health Check` endpoint `https://$HOSTNAME:8443/health-check`. This should return `{"status":"running"}` ensuring the successful installation of client-api.

Call the [client API](./api/index.md) to implement authentication and authorization against an external Authorization Server.
    
## API

Janssen client-api implements the [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) and [UMA 2.0](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-05.html) profiles of OAuth 2.0.

!!! Attention
    By default Janssen client-api allows only `localhost` to access its apis. To make request from another server or VM add its ip-address to `bind_ip_addresses` array in `jans-client-api-server.yml`. Check `bind_ip_addresses` in [configurations](./configuration/oxd-configuration/index.md#server-configuration-fields-descriptions) for details.
    
Before using Janssen client-api you need to obtain an access token to secure the interaction with `client-api-server`. You can follow the two steps below. 

 - [Register site](./api/index.md#register-site) (returns `client_id` and `client_secret`. Make sure the `uma_protection` scope is present in the request and `grant_type` has `client_credentials` value. If `add_client_credentials_grant_type_automatically_during_client_registration` field in `/opt/oxd-server/conf/oxd-server.yml` is set to `true` then `client_credentials` grant type will be automatically added to clients registered using oxd server.)
 - [Get client token](./api/index.md#get-client-token) (pass `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain `access_token`. Note if `grant_type` does not have `client_credentials` value you will get error to check AS logs.)
 
Pass the obtained access token in `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header in all future calls to the `client-api-server`.

### OpenID Connect Authentication

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0. 

Technically OpenID Connect is not an authentication protocol--it enables a person to authorize the release of personal information from an "identity provider" to a separate application. In the process of authorizing the release of information, the person is authenticated (if no previous session exists).  

#### Authentication Flow
Client-api supports the OpenID Connect [Hybrid Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) and [Authorization Code Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) for authentication. 

Learn more about authentication flows in the [OpenID Connect spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). 

#### Client-api Authorization Code Flow

You can think of the Authorization Code Flow as a three-step process: 

 - Redirect a person to the authorization URL and obtain a code [/get-authorization-url](./api/index.md#get-authorization-url)
 - Use the code to obtain tokens (access_token, id_token and refresh_token) [/get-tokens-id-access-by-code](./api/index.md#get-tokens-id-access-by-code)
 - Use the access token to obtain user claims [/get-user-info](./api/index.md#get-user-info)

### UMA 2 Authorization 

UMA 2 is a profile of OAuth 2.0 that defines RESTful, JSON-based, standardized flows and constructs for coordinating the protection of APIs and web resources. 

Using jans-client-api, your application can delegate access management decisions, like who can access which resources, from what devices, to a central UMA Authorization Server (AS) like the [Janssen AS](https://jans.io/docs/ce/admin-guide/uma/). 
 

## Native Libraries

Client APIs are [swaggerized](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-client-api/blob/master/server/src/main/resources/swagger.yaml)! Use the [Swagger Code Generator](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to generate native libraries for your programming language of choice. 

It is easy to generate appropriate client via https://app.swaggerhub.com GUI, just add swagger spec and in upper right corner it's possible to download client.

## Compatibility
Janssen client-api has been tested against the following OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers:
